# Flight Fare Prediction: 

## Edit
This is a extension of the project https://github.com/Mandal-21/Flight-Price-Prediction.git where I have pushed a new fligh_rf.pkl (101MB) file to the main repository using git-lfs (Large File Storage) to give a more accurate predicion of plane fares. I have created a guide detailing the steps of this process with regards to upload in github and deployment in heroku.
This could not be a contribution to the original project as github does not allow git-lfs uploads to forked repositories where the main repository does not contain a git-lfs uploaded file.

## Overview
This is a Flask web app which predicts fare of Flight ticket.

## Motivation
What to do when you are at home due to this pandemic situation? I started to learn Machine Learning model to get most out of it. I came to know mathematics behind all supervised models. Finally it is important to work on application (real world application) to actually make a difference.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.6.10. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Deployement on Heroku
Login or signup in order to create virtual app. You can either connect your github profile or download ctl to manually deploy this project.

Our next step would be to follow the instruction given on [Heroku Documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python) to deploy a web app.

## Bug / Feature Request

If you find a bug (the website couldn't handle the query and / or gave undesired results), kindly open an [issue](https://github.com/Mandal-21/Flight-Price-Prediction/issues) here by including your search query and the expected result

## Future Scope

* Use multiple Algorithms
* Optimize Flask app.py
* Front-End 

## Git LFS

GIT-LFS is required to push the tuned hyper-parameter model to the master repo as github does not allow upload of files larger than 100MB. The process of git-lfs installation and execution can be seen here. The heroku app also needs some buildpacks and convig variables added for compatibility with git-lfs.
